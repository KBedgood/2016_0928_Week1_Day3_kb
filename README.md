### Learning Objectives:

Let's get some hands-on practice with these new tools by building a little web page. By the end of this exercise you should be able to create basic HTML structures and style them. You should be familiar with the core set of tags and how to target them with CSS.

### Mission:

Build a homepage for your local ice cream shop. It should contain at least:

- the shop's name and a brief history
- a logo (any image you can find online)
- the store's hours and contact information
- the flavors available with:
name, calorie count, and whether it is sugar free or not
a link to wikipedia for that flavor

The page should use proper semantic HTML tags and be styled to taste. Every other flavor on the menu should alternate its background color (commonly called "zebra striping") for easier reading. What type of structure would you use for this menu?

When done, save your page in a gist, and submit a link to that gist.

### Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
